<h1>Trading Bot</h1>

<p>This project is a fun project intended to explore new ways of using Node.js to build applications in different domains. This is an open-source trading-bot, you can clone the repo and make configurations as you see fit.</p> <p>In any case, by no means will I advice this project to be used for production or a large scale. It is far from a finished product</p>.

<h1>Third Party APIs</h1>

<strong>Binance API</strong>: Uses Binance API to create buy and sell orders
<strong>Coin Gecko API</strong>: Uses Coin gecko for fetching the market price of the coin of choice
